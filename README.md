# DrossProto

A top-down 2D role-playing game about death, mushrooms, and new growth. WIP.

The money-making parts of this are the CustomPhysicsController (Scripts/General/CustomPhysicsController.cs) and the Character controller (Scripts/Character/Character.cs) and its implementations (Scripts/Character/NPCs/EnemyAI.cs and Scripts/Character/Player/PlayerControlle.cs).
