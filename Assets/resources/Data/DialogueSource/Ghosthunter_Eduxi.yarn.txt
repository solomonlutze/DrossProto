The ones here are straightforward enough. They'll just kill you.

Deeper in the forest, though, there's older ones. Stranger ones. Cursed spores that linger in the soul.

There's more at stake than death when you deal with ghosts. If you go in there, you're not just risking your life.

Stay on your guard.

This is as close as we can safely get to the Forest north of here, mostly because it's full of mushrooms that will kill you very quickly.

<<set $eduxi_camp_explained to true>>
In fact, if you look below us you can see some of them. Watch your step.

I thought it would be self-evident.

Ghosts wander out of the forest. We keep them from getting to civilization. Ghosts don't mingle well with polite company.
->Can't you try to reason with them?
	Ghosts are inherently unreasonable. They're ghosts. 
->Can't you go into the forest and kill them all?
	Ha! I love it. I love your enthusiasm.
	But, no. That's a singularly terrible idea. The forest is poisonous to the living, and the ghosts in there...
	Well. Suffice it to say, it's not feasible. So we set up a perimeter, and we keep what we can from getting out.

Do you believe in ghosts, pilgrim?

-> Of course.
	Ha. Good. Good. But are you afraid of them?
	-> Yes?
		Hm. Well. We'll see. We'll see.
	->No?
		Hm. Well. We'll see. We'll see.

-> Of course not.
	Hah. They don't believe in you either.

Name's Eduxi. I'm the captain of the Ghosthunter camp, which is the thing you're standing in. You can call me "Captain."
