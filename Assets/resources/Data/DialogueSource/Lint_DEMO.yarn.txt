Grab some of the lymph inside and try assigning them to your pupa - your next life. Press "I" to see your inventory. When you want to try out your pupa, press "=" to die!

The same lymph will have different effects in different slots, so try them out! You can read the provided readme for a breakdown of what the different traits do.

Otherwise, just mess around - if you find another NPC you've basically got it all figured out.

If not, just keep track of stuff you can't figure out how to do or things that aren't surfaced well.
