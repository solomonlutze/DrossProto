Hi! Find my 3 friends to complete the demo. You can also find Trophy Grubs around to help you feel better about yourself. 

Everything else is in the readme. Good luck!

Congratulations! That means you've beaten the demo!

I hope you won't be too offended if I don't go check it out. Scripted motion for cutscenes isn't implemented yet, plus it sucks down there.

Go kill some bugs and steal their lymph!

You can equip lymph to each of the different body parts - head, thorax, abdomen, legs, wings - of your pupa, or next life.

Whenever you get around to dying, you'll respawn with the body parts equipped to your pupa. 

Different parts have different effects, so experiment with equipping different lymphs to the same slot, or the same lymph to different slots.

The finished game will have a dense, winding world, full of strange bugs to flirt with and a life-or-death confrontation with extinction and empire.

But this is just a demo, and I locked myself out of my basement, so if you can just get that resolved that's fine for now. 

And I'd really appreciate it.

[[great, thanks|Lint_DEMO.Leave]]

Your starting bug has one of three abilities: water walking, burrowing, or fungus protection. 

Find whichever two of those you're missing,  and use all three abilities to get under the house, right below where we are now. 

There's a few kinds of bug around here - they'll have what you need!

If you kill them, I mean.
