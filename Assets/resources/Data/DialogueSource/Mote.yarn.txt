Uhhhhhh hmmmmmm 

-> what?

Well, it's the mushrooms

outside, i mean.

They're kind of poisonous.

i mean.

They're very poisonous.

i mean, 

you'll die.

-> hm. 

Right. Exactly!

Hm.

-> any advice?

Once you leave the hole there's a path dead west of here,

Wow that was a very unfortunate turn of phrase

There's a path directly west of here - you have to cut across some mushrooms but. You'll probably survive.

Good, luck.
<<set $mote_met to true>>
<<else>>

Hi,
-> where do I go again?
	West - you have to cut through some mushrooms for a bit but you'll find a clearing and a path.

Oh. I'm a ceramicist. We make you your new bodies. When you die, you'll be reincarneted in a body one of us has available, with the abilities from your last life's pupa.

We all live pretty far apart so you might be kind of lost at first? I advise just looking around some.

-> thanks
-> no like, who are you
	Oh. I'm Mote.
	->Hi, Mote.
		Hi.
